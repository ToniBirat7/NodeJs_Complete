    "`ES6` is the modern version of JavaScript, which includes many new features and improvements over the previous versions. This cheat sheet provides a quick reference to some of the most commonly used ES6 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Chrome V8 Engine**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chrome V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google for the Chrome browser. It is designed to execute JavaScript code quickly and efficiently, making it a popular choice for web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Node` is built on the V8 engine, which allows it to run JavaScript code outside of the browser environment. This enables developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming, creating a unified language for both client-side and server-side development.\n",
    "\n",
    "`V8` is written in C++ and is known for its high performance and low memory usage. It compiles JavaScript code to machine code at runtime, which allows it to execute code quickly. The V8 engine also includes a garbage collector that automatically manages memory, freeing up resources when they are no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to write our own `C++` code and use it in `Node.js` as a native module. This is useful for performance-critical applications or when we need to access low-level system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **JavaScript Runtime**\n",
    "\n",
    "A JavaScript runtime is an environment that allows JavaScript code to be executed. It provides the necessary APIs and libraries for running JavaScript outside of a web browser. The most popular JavaScript runtime is `Node.js`, which is built on the V8 engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every browser has its own JavaScript runtime, which allows it to execute JavaScript code. The runtime provides access to the browser's APIs, such as the DOM (Document Object Model) and the BOM (Browser Object Model), enabling developers to interact with web pages and perform various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the components of a JavaScript runtime:\n",
    "\n",
    "**v8 Engine**: The core JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code. It compiles JavaScript to machine code for fast execution. The `V8` engine has `Call Stack`, and `Heap` memory for managing function calls and objects, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web APIs**: A set of APIs provided by the browser that allows JavaScript to interact with the browser and perform tasks such as manipulating the DOM, making network requests, and handling events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web APIs are not part of the JavaScript language itself but are provided by the browser environment. Examples include `XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch`, `DOM manipulation`, and `event handling`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event Loop**: A mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations. It manages the execution of code, events, and messages in a non-blocking manner. It continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue to determine what to execute next.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callback Queue**: A queue that holds callbacks for asynchronous operations. When an asynchronous operation completes, its callback is added to the queue, and the event loop processes it when the call stack is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Call Stack**: A stack that keeps track of function calls. When a function is called, it is added to the stack, and when it returns, it is removed from the stack. The call stack is used to manage the execution context of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Microtask Queue**: A queue that holds microtasks, which are tasks that need to be executed after the current task but before the next event loop iteration. Microtasks include promises and mutation observers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to provide a run time outside the browser, we need to have `Node.js`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Node.js**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Node.js` is a JavaScript runtime built on the V8 engine that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides a rich set of APIs for building server-side applications, making it a popular choice for web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Node.js is designed to be lightweight and efficient, using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This makes it suitable for building scalable network applications that can handle a large number of concurrent connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Node.js is built on the V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript code to machine code for fast execution. It also includes a built-in package manager called `npm` (Node Package Manager), which allows developers to easily install and manage third-party libraries and modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodejs does not have access to the browser's APIs, such as the DOM and BOM, because it is designed to run outside of a web browser. Instead, it provides its own set of APIs for file system access, networking, and other server-side tasks.\n",
    "\n",

    "[NodeJs_Github_Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQT6XiJt4DE&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwh8shCMHFA5kWxD9PaPwxaY&index=5)\n",
    "\n",
    "In browser, we could not access the file system directly, but in Node.js, we can use the `fs` module to read and write files on the server. This allows us to create server-side applications that can interact with the file system, such as reading configuration files, serving static files, or writing logs.\n"

    "## **Playing Around with Node.js**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **REPL**\n",
    "\n",
    "`REPL` stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive programming environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code in real-time. You can use it to test code snippets, explore the language, and debug your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the REPL in Node.js, simply open your terminal and type `node`. This will launch the REPL, where you can enter JavaScript code and see the results immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Modules**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Node.js, modules are reusable pieces of code that can be imported and used in other files. This allows you to organize your code into separate files, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a module, you can use the `module.exports` object to export functions, objects, or variables from a file. You can then import the module in another file using the `require` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of modules in Node.js:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Core Modules**: These are built-in modules that come with Node.js, such as `fs` (file system), `http` (HTTP server), and `path` (file path utilities). You can use them without installing any additional packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Third-Party Modules**: These are modules that you can install from the npm registry. You can use the `npm install` command to install them, and then require them in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Local Modules**: These are modules that you create in your own project. You can organize your code into separate files and require them as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Local Modules**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a local module in Node.js, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new file with a `.js` extension, for example, `myModule.js`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the CommonJs module system to create a local module in Node.js. Here's an example of how to create and use a local module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// myModule.js\n",
    "const greet = (name) => {\n",
    "  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  greet,\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// main.js\n",
    "const myModule = require(\"./myModule\");\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(myModule.greet(\"Alice\"));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `require` function is used to import the local module, and you can access the exported functions or variables using the object returned by `require`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Module Exports**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Node.js, you can export functions, objects, or variables from a module using the `module.exports` object. This allows other files to import and use the exported functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to export a function from a module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// myModule.js\n",
    "const add = (a, b) => {\n",
    "  return a + b;\n",
    "};\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  add,\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// main.js\n",
    "const myModule = require(\"./myModule\");\n",
    "console.log(myModule.add(5, 10)); // Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we use `module.exports`, we are defining what will be available to other files that import this module. This allows us to encapsulate functionality and keep our code organized. When `require` is called, it retrieves the exported object from the specified module file and returns it, allowing us to access the functions or variables defined in that module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module Scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Node.js, each module has its own scope. This means that variables and functions defined in one module are not accessible in another module unless they are explicitly exported. This helps to prevent naming conflicts and keeps the code organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each loaded module in `Node.js` is wrapped with an `IIFE` (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to create a private scope. This means that variables defined in one module are not accessible in another module unless they are explicitly exported.\n",
    "\n",
    "`IIFE` helps to create a private scope for each module, preventing global namespace pollution and allowing modules to have their own private variables and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we can create private variables and functions within a module that are not accessible from outside the module. This helps to encapsulate functionality and prevent naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, even if we've two modules with the same variable names, they won't interfere with each other because they are in separate scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Module Wrapper**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a module is loaded in `Node.js`, it is wrapped in an `IIFE` (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to create a private scope. This is known as the module wrapper. The wrapper function takes `exports`, `require`, `module`, and `__filename` and `__dirname` as parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how the module wrapper looks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {\n",
    "  // Your module code goes here\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exports**: An object that is used to export functions, objects, or variables from the module. It is the same as `module.exports`, but it allows you to add properties to the exports object without overwriting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Require**: A function that is used to import other modules. It takes a module identifier (the path to the module) as an argument and returns the exported object from that module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module**: An object that represents the current module. It contains information about the module, such as its exports and filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\_\\_filename**: A string that contains the absolute path to the current module file. It is useful for getting the file path of the current module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\_\\_dirname**: A string that contains the absolute path to the directory that contains the current module file. It is useful for constructing file paths relative to the current module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Module Caching**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a module is loaded in Node.js, it is cached to improve performance. This means that if the same module is required multiple times, Node.js will return the cached version instead of loading it again. This helps to reduce the overhead of loading modules and speeds up the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how module caching works in Node.js:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When a module is required for the first time, Node.js loads the module and executes its code.\n",
    "2. The module's exports are cached in the `require.cache` object, which is a key-value store where the key is the module's absolute file path and the value is the module's exports object.\n",
    "3. If the same module is required again, Node.js checks the `require.cache` object to see if the module is already cached.\n",
    "4. If the module is cached, Node.js returns the cached exports object instead of loading the module again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of module caching:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// module_cache.js\n",
    "\n",
    "class SuperHero {\n",
    "  constructor(name, power) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "    this.power = power;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  display() {\n",
    "    console.log(`SuperHero: ${this.name}, Power: ${this.power}`);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  getName() {\n",
    "    return this.name;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  getPower() {\n",
    "    return this.power;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  setName(name) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  setPower(power) {\n",
    "    this.power = power;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "module.exports = new SuperHero(\"Spider-Man\", \"Web-slinging\");\n",
    "// This code defines a SuperHero class with properties name and power, and methods to display and get/set these properties.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// index.js\n",
    "\n",
    "const SuperHero = require(\"./module_caching.js\");\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(`SuperHero Name: ${SuperHero.getName()}`); // This line retrieves the name of the SuperHero\n",
    "SuperHero.setName(\"Iron Man\");\n",
    "console.log(`Updated SuperHero Name: ${SuperHero.getName()}`); // This line retrieves the updated name of the SuperHero\n",
    "\n",
    "// New SuperHero instance is not created here, instead the existing one is modified\n",
    "\n",
    "const newSuperHero = require(\"./module_caching.js\"); // This line re-imports the SuperHero module to reflect the changes made\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(`New SuperHero Name: ${newSuperHero.getName()}`); // This line retrieves the name of the SuperHero from the new instance\n",
    "// This demonstrates that the SuperHero module is cached and the same instance is used across imports\n",
    "\n",
    "// Output:\n",
    "// SuperHero Name: Spider-Man\n",
    "// Updated SuperHero Name: Iron Man\n",
    "// New SuperHero Name: Iron Man\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that when we import the `SuperHero` module again, it returns the same instance that was modified earlier. This is because Node.js caches the module exports, allowing us to maintain state across different imports of the same module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we've imported the `SuperHero` module again, it does not create a new instance. Instead, it returns the same instance that was modified earlier. This is because Node.js caches the module exports, allowing us to maintain state across different imports of the same module.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can know the step wise step execution of code with `Debugger` tool in `VS Code`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the second import retrived from the cache, as we've exported the instance of the `SuperHero` class directly. This means that any changes made to the instance will be reflected in all imports of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if we had exported the class itself instead of an instance, each import would create a new instance of the class, and changes made to one instance would not affect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Import Export Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Node.js, there are several patterns for importing and exporting modules. Here are some common patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Default Export**: You can export a single value as the default export of a module. This is useful when you want to export a single function or class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// myModule.js\n",
    "const greet = (name) => {\n",
    "  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n",
    "};\n",
    "module.exports = greet;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// index.js\n",
    "const greet = require(\"./myModule.js\");\n",
    "console.log(greet(\"Alice\")); // Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Named Exports**: You can export multiple values from a module using named exports with `Objects`. This allows you to export multiple functions or variables from the same module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// myModule.js\n",
    "const greet = (name) => {\n",
    "  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n",
    "};\n",
    "const farewell = (name) => {\n",
    "  return `Goodbye, ${name}!`;\n",
    "};\n",
    "module.exports = { greet, farewell };\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// index.js\n",
    "const { greet, farewell } = require(\"./myModule.js\");\n",
    "console.log(greet(\"Alice\")); // Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "console.log(farewell(\"Alice\")); // Output: Goodbye, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exporting an Object**: You can export an object that contains multiple properties, allowing you to group related functions or variables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// myModule.js\n",
    "const myModule = {\n",
    "  greet: (name) => {\n",
    "    return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  farewell: (name) => {\n",
    "    return `Goodbye, ${name}!`;\n",
    "  },\n",
    "};\n",
    "module.exports = myModule;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// index.js\n",
    "const myModule = require(\"./myModule.js\");\n",
    "console.log(myModule.greet(\"Alice\")); // Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "console.log(myModule.farewell(\"Alice\")); // Output: Goodbye, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Modules.exports vs exports**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Node.js, `module.exports` and `exports` are both used to export functionality from a module, but they have different behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `module.exports` is the actual object that is returned when a module is required. It can be assigned to any value, including functions, objects, or primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `exports` is a shorthand reference to `module.exports`. However, if you assign a new value to `exports`, it will not affect `module.exports`. To avoid confusion, it's recommended to use `module.exports` when exporting a single value or object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// myModule.js\n",
    "const add = (a, b) => {\n",
    "  return a + b;\n",
    "};\n",
    "// This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.\n",
    "// It is exported as a module so that it can be used in other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "const subtract = (a, b) => {\n",
    "  return a - b;\n",
    "};\n",
    "// This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their difference.\n",
    "// It is exported as a module so that it can be used in other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "exports = {\n",
    "  add,\n",
    "  subtract,\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "// index.js\n",
    "const myModule = require(\"./myModule.js\");\n",
    "console.log(myModule.add(5, 10)); // Output: 15\n",
    "console.log(myModule.subtract(10, 5)); // Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "// Output : Error, add.add is not a function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we assigned a new object to `exports`, it no longer points to `module.exports`. Therefore, when we try to access the `add` and `subtract` functions, we get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are importing a module, the `IIFE` wrapper returns a reference to `module.exports`. If we assign a new value to `exports`, it will not change the value of `module.exports`.\n",
    "This can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior, especially if we try to access the exported functions or variables later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are assigning a new object to `exports`, which does not affect `module.exports`. As a result, when we try to access the `add` and `subtract` functions, we get an error because they are not defined in the new object assigned to `exports`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this issue, we should use `module.exports` directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ES Module**\n",
    "\n",
    "When Node was first introduced, it used the CommonJS module system, which is based on `require` and `module.exports`. However, with the introduction of ES6, a new module system was introduced that uses `import` and `export` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ES module system is designed to be more flexible and powerful than the CommonJS module system. It allows for static analysis of imports and exports, enabling better optimization and tree-shaking in build tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use ES modules in Node.js, you need to either:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `.mjs` file extension for your module files.\n",
    "2. Set the `\"type\": \"module\"` field in your `package.json` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use ES modules in Node.js:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// myModule.mjs\n",
    "export const greet = (name) => {\n",
    "  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n",
    "};\n",
    "// index.mjs\n",
    "import { greet } from \"./myModule.mjs\";\n",
    "console.log(greet(\"Alice\")); // Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "\n",
    "// To run this, use the command: node --experimental-modules index.mjs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Named Exports vs Default Exports**\n",
    "\n",
    "In ES modules, you can export multiple values using named exports or a single value using a default export.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of both:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// myModule.mjs\n",
    "export const greet = (name) => {\n",
    "  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\n",
    "};\n",
    "export const farewell = (name) => {\n",
    "  return `Goodbye, ${name}!`;\n",
    "};\n",
    "export default (name) => {\n",
    "  return `Welcome, ${name}!`;\n",
    "};\n",
    "// index.mjs\n",
    "import { greet, farewell } from \"./myModule.mjs\";\n",
    "import welcome from \"./myModule.mjs\"; // Importing the default export\n",
    "console.log(greet(\"Alice\")); // Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "console.log(farewell(\"Alice\")); // Output: Goodbye, Alice!\n",
    "console.log(welcome(\"Alice\")); // Output: Welcome, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have both named exports (`greet` and `farewell`) and a default export (the welcome function). You can import named exports using curly braces, while the default export can be imported without them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the default export can be anything you choose, as it is not tied to the name of the exported function or variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if you want to import both named exports and the default export from the same module.\n"

    "### **Charsets, Buffers, Streams and Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Node.js, working with data often involves handling different character sets, buffers, streams, and encoding. Understanding these concepts is essential for efficiently processing and manipulating data in your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Charsets**: A charset (character set) defines the mapping between characters and their corresponding byte representations. Common charsets include UTF-8, ASCII, and ISO-8859-1. Node.js provides built-in support for various charsets, allowing you to encode and decode data correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when I write \"A\", first it is mapped to correspoing ASCII value, which is 65. Then, it is converted to binary representation, which is 01000001. This binary representation is then stored in a buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "`console.log(\"A\".charCodeAt());` : 65\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular charsets include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UTF-8**: A variable-length encoding that can represent all Unicode characters. It is the default encoding in Node.js and is widely used for web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ASCII**: A 7-bit character encoding that represents English characters and control characters. It is a subset of UTF-8 and is commonly used for simple text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Character Encoding**: Character encoding is the process of converting characters into a specific byte representation. In Node.js, you can specify the encoding when reading or writing files, sending HTTP responses, or processing data streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Character encoding dictates how to represent a character set as binary data before it can be stored or transmitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "It dicates how many bits are used to represent each character, and how those bits are arranged in memory or on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stream**: A stream is a sequence of data that is being moved from one place to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Reading a file line by line, processing data in chunks, or sending data over a network connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Node.js, streams are used to handle large amounts of data efficiently without loading the entire data into memory at once. Streams can be readable, writable, or both (duplex).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when reading a file, you can use a readable stream to read the file in chunks, process each chunk, and then write the processed data to another file using a writable stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, when watching a Youtube video, the video is streamed to your device in small chunks, allowing you to start watching it before the entire video is downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if we are copying the contents of a file to another file , we can use streams to read the source file in chunks and write those chunks to the destination file without loading the entire file into memory. Instead of loading the content of entire file into memory, we can read and write data in smaller chunks, which is more efficient and reduces memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents unnecessary memory consumption and allows for efficient data processing, especially when dealing with large files or data streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "_But how exactly the data moves?_\n",
    "\n",
    "**Buffer**: A buffer is a temporary storage area in memory that holds binary data. It is used to store data that is being read from or written to a stream. Buffers are essential for handling binary data efficiently in Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand with an analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine there a roller coaster that can accomodate 30 people at a time. But we don't know at what pace people will come to ride the roller coaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "If 100 people come at once, we can't let them all ride the roller coaster at the same time. Instead, we can let them in batches of 30 people at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If 1 person comes, we can let them ride the roller coaster immediately we will need to wait for more people to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the area where people wait to ride the roller coaster is like a `buffer`. It holds the people until they can ride the roller coaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Node.js` cannot control the pace at which data arrives in the stream, so it uses `buffers` to store the data temporarily until it can be processed. This allows Node.js to handle data efficiently without blocking the event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can only decide when is the right time to process the data in the buffer, which is when the buffer is full or when there is no more data to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an intentional design choice to use buffers in Node.js, as it allows for efficient handling of data streams without blocking the event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example, when we are streaming a video. If we have a fast internet connection, the speed of the stream will be fast enough to instantly fill up the buffer and sent it for processing. But if we have a slow internet connection, the buffer will fill up slowly, and we will have to wait for the data to arrive before we can start playing the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Buffers in Node.js, you can create a buffer using the `Buffer` class. You can create a buffer from a string, an array, or by allocating a specific size.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't need to import it as it is a built-in class in Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Js\n",
    "\n",
    "const buffer = new Buffer.from(\"Birat\", \"utf-8\"); // Creating a buffer from a string\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we try to ovveride the created buffer object, it will only store the character that matches the lenght of the first buffer. The rest of the characters will be ignored.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we created a buffer from the string \"Birat\", which is 5 characters long. When we write \"ABC\" to the buffer, it only stores the first 3 characters (A, B, C) and ignores the rest. The remaining characters in the buffer are replaced with the new characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the buffer has a fixed size, and when we write to it, it overwrites the existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a buffer of a specific size using the `Buffer.alloc(size)` method, which allocates a buffer of the specified size and initializes it with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Js\n",
    "\n",
    "const buffer = new Buffer.from(\"Birat\");\n",

    "\n",
    "It has the main thread of execution, which is responsible for executing the code in a sequential manner. This means that if we have a long-running operation, such as reading a file or making a network request, it will block the main thread until it is finished.\n",
